# List Comprehension
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)

# With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(newlist)

# Condiction 
newlist = [x for x in range(10)]

print(newlist)

#
newlist = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5]

print(newlist)
